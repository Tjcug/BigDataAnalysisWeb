# BigDataAnalysisWeb
* A big data throughput test analysis platform.
* Analyze storm, spark, and flink throughput changes in the form of graphs.
* Keep the analysis results and display them in a centralized page.
* Storm throughput real-time UI presentation, which can display the system throughput model in real time. And you can save the experimental results, so that you can focus on the results of the next analysis.
